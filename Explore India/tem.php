         <p><i>A temple is a building where people go to practice their religion. In a temple people may perform religious rituals, ceremonies, and pray. Thus, a temple is a general term for a house of worshipVedagiriswarar temple is a Hindu temple located in Tirukalukundram (also known as Thirukazhukundram), Tamil Nadu, India. Thirukalukundram is one of the most famous pilgrim centres in Tamilnadu, renowned for its Hill Temple ad Sangu Theertham. It is named after the sacred Eagles who visit every noon at the Hill Temple called Pakshi Theertham and the Kailash of South India. ‘Kazhugu’ in Tamil means ‘eagle’ and ‘kundram’ the ‘hill’, hence the name of the place Tiru Kazhu Kundram. Even today two eagles visit the temple every day to accept the sweet rice offered to them. To watch these eagles taking the food is a rare experience. After a darshan of Vedagiriswarar, devotees eagerly await the arrival of the eagles just before noon. They wait in large numbers at a shed specially erected for the purpose. After cleaning a particular spot on the adjacent boulder, the temple priest sits down, with the food (sakkarai pongal). Two eagles, after circling around temple top, come near the priest walking. They eat the balls of rice and after cleaning their beaks in the water kept in a small vessel nearby, take off, circle around the tower again and fly off. This has been going on for centuries now. Many tales are told about the visit of the two eagles. Two rishis (sages) — Pusha and Vidhadha were cursed by Lord Siva to become eagles, for some indiscretion. It is believed that these are the two eagles that visit Thirukazhukundram daily for time immemorial, in order to worship Siva and to obtain salvation from His curse. It is said that after a bath in the Ganges in the morning, they come here at noon for food, reach Rameswaram in the evening for darshan and return to Chidambaram for the night. Legend says they would regain their original form and attain moksha (salvation) at the end of Kali Yuga<i></p>
