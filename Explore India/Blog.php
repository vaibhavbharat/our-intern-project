                <h1 >  SAHARA DESERT  </h1>
                    The Sahara Desert is the world's largest hot desert and the third largest desert behind Antarctica and the Arctic. Located in North Africa, it covers large sections of the continent - covering 9,200,000 square kilometers which is comparable to the are of China or the US! If you're joining us on our Sahara Desert Trek or just want to find out some interesting facts about the Sahara then keep reading to fuel your wanderlust!

 

How Hot Is The Sahara Desert?
The Sahara is the hottest desert in the world – with one of the harshest climates. The average annual temperature is 30°C, whilst the hottest temperature ever recorded was 58°C. The area receives little rainfall, in fact, half of the Sahara Desert receives less than 1 inch of rain every year.

Despite many thinking of the Sahara as a constantly hot climate, temperatures drop dramatically at night, due to the lack of humidity, and can reach lows of -6°C. Snow falls regularly on several mountain ranges, but nowhere else in the Sahara. 

 

How Big Is The Sahara Desert?
The Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert in the world, and the third largest overall after the Antarctica and the Arctic. The Sahara Desert covers an incredible 9.2 million km², which is almost the same size as China, and a total of 8% of the earth’s land area. Impressive!The Sahara is much more than just sand – in fact, the majority of the Sahara is made up of barren, rocky plateaus, as well as salt flats, sand dunes, mountains and dry valleys. The rivers and streams found in the Sahara are all seasonal, apart from the River Nile.

There are over 20 lakes in the Sahara, most of which are saltwater lakes. Lake Chad is the only freshwater lake in the desert.

The highest peak in the Sahara is Emi Koussi (3,415m), a volcano located in Tibesti Mountains, Chad. Other mountain ranges in the area include the Aïr Mountains, Saharan Atlas, Adrar des Iforas, Hoggar Mountains, Tibesti Mountains, and the Red Sea hills.

                <h1 > LIFE IN JUNGLE  </h1>
                    Jungles are the most ecologically diverse habitat on Earth.

Jungles have played an essential part in preserving the planet as it is and being home to incredible flora and fauna. Jungles have been a blessing to humanity.

Jungles are all about trees and vegetation. The forests, tropical forests, rain forests, wilderness, wild, bush, and so on are practically synonyms to the word jungle. The continuous vegetating process helps the jungle area to flourish. They also help a lot in the agricultural process, and it helps in bringing out the rain needed for vegetation growth. People have been blessed with food and water every day and fresh air to breathe due to the involvement of Jungles. They contribute. Jungles can filter out the impurities in the air too.

Jungle means something in the wild and dangerous. The word jungle has different origins. The jungle is known to be the heart of the Earth. The most famous writer Rudyard Kipling explained the Indian jungles well in the famous book called 'The Jungle Book.' Jungles are all about various species, plants, and amazing biodiversity zones. Today, jungles are being cut down due to industrialization, which, in turn, is causing massive havoc in the rest of the world as well. The weather in the forests is always hot and humid. One can expect rains too. Let us learn more about the jungle adventure.

WildlifeJust like the jungles helps out in carrying out different processes on Earth, wildlife takes a role in it.

Wildlife is a part of the ecosystem, and it provides balance and stability to nature's processes.
